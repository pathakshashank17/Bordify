    Bordify is an extremely basic chrome extension that will hopefully help in mastering the art ðŸŽ¨ of aligning stuff. It works by adding a translucent yellow border to elements that becomes darker as the element becomes more nested. Also it adds a red border to element on hovering above it so that its outline becomes visible. Nothing too fancy âœ¨.
